# Heatwaves and Older Adults: A Web Map of Risk Across the Contiguous United States

This interactive web map explores the intersection of extreme heat exposure and the aging population across the contiguous United States. Inspired by Boston University's article, [“Extreme Heat Will Put More Older Adults in Danger”](https://www.bu.edu/articles/2024/extreme-heat-will-put-more-older-adults-in-danger/), the application identifies counties where older adults—who face heightened vulnerability to heat—may be at greatest risk from compounding climate and demographic stressors.

The bivariate map uses two primary datasets:
- **Heatwave exposure** from 2011 to 2024, calculated using a 45-day moving window of daily average temperatures, identifying 2-day events that exceed the 90th percentile threshold.
- **Population age 65 and older**, based on the 2021 American Community Survey (ACS) 5-Year Estimates.

Users can toggle between bivariate and univariate views, zoom to individual states or counties, and explore detailed popups by hovering or clicking on specific counties. The goal of this map is to support public awareness, policy dialogue, and climate adaptation efforts by pinpointing vulnerable communities where aging and heat converge.

Created by **Caleb Blackburn**, the map integrates climate and demographic data to visualize risk and promote heat resilience planning at the local level.
